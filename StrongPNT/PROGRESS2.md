### Attempted
- Fixed compilation error in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean at line 540-548
- Issue: Invalid field `analyticWithinAt` on existential type
- Solution: Used `obtain ⟨p, hp⟩` to destructure the existential and apply mono to the subset

### Implementation Details
- In `lem_analAtOnOn`, the hypothesis `hT` returns `∃ p, HasFPowerSeriesWithinAt`
- Cannot directly access `.analyticWithinAt` on an existential
- Fixed by destructuring with `obtain` and applying `mono` with the subset proof
- The subset {w | norm w ≤ R ∧ w ≠ 0} ⊆ {w | norm w ≤ R} is proven by projection

### Current Status
- Fixed compilation error at line 540-548 
- Multiple other compilation errors remain in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Total sorries: 149 (18 in PNT1, 32 in PNT2, 34 in PNT3, 44 in PNT4, 21 in PNT5)
- Build still has errors that need systematic fixing

### Next Steps
- Continue fixing remaining compilation errors
- Focus on simpler proofs that don't require complex machinery
- Target basic algebraic and analytic lemmas
