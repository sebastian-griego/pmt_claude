# Progress Log

## Iteration 48 (2025-09-23T01:40:00Z)

### Fixed
- Linter automatically fixed issues in PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean
  - Fixed various import statements and type conversions
  - Cleaned up complex arithmetic operations

### Progress
- Reduced sorry count from 165 to 164 (34+35+33+41+21)
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis: 34 sorries (unchanged)
  - PNT2_LogDerivative: 35 sorries (unchanged)
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta: 33 sorries (unchanged)
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion: 41 sorries (was 42)
  - PNT5_StrongPNT: 21 sorries (unchanged)
- Build completes successfully with no errors
- All remaining sorries are for non-trivial mathematical theorems

### Next Steps
- Continue searching for simple computational lemmas
- Focus on PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion which has the most sorries (41)
- Look for arithmetic lemmas that can be proven with basic tactics
