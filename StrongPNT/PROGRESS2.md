### Fixed
- Fixed Complex.arg_coe_of_pos usage in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean (line 62)
  - Replaced Complex.arg_natCast with Complex.arg_coe_of_pos 
  - Used Nat.cast_pos to show positivity
- Fixed Real.rpow_neg usage in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean (line 77, 270) 
  - Changed from positivity to nonnegativity requirement
- Fixed Real.sqrt calculation in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean (line 279)
  - Replaced Real.rpow_natCast_mul with simpler norm_num proof
- Fixed Nat.cast_ne_zero usage in PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean (line 404, 430)
  - Replaced Complex.natCast_ne_zero.mpr with Nat.cast_ne_zero.mpr
- Fixed type conversion in PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean (line 429-431)
  - Properly converted between n â‰  0 and 0 < n using Nat.pos_of_ne_zero

### Remaining Issues  
- PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean line 537: subset proof issue (left as sorry)
- Additional errors in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean around differentiability

### Progress
- Sorry count: 197 (unchanged due to new sorry added)
- Made progress on multiple type-checking errors
- Lake build partially successful

### Next Steps
- Fix remaining differentiability errors in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Continue reducing sorry count in other files
