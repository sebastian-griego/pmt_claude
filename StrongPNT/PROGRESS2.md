# Prime Number Theorem Progress Tracker

## Overall Status
- Total sorries: 163
- Files needing work: PNT1_ComplexAnalysis (34), PNT2_LogDerivative (35), PNT3_RiemannZeta (33), PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion (41), PNT5_StrongPNT (21)

## Iteration 2 - 2025-09-23T20:50:26Z

### Focus: Attempted to reduce sorries
- Examined PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean (41 sorries)
- Attempted to fix `zeta_converges_re_gt_one` in PNT3_RiemannZeta
- Hit API compatibility issues with Mathlib functions

### Progress:
- Identified that PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion has the most sorries (41)
- Found that many complex analysis lemmas require deep theorems (maximum modulus, etc)
- PNT3_RiemannZeta has some lemmas already proved (abs_p_pow_s, p_s_abs_1)

### Blockers:
- Many lemmas require deep complex analysis results not easily accessible
- Mathlib API differences make some proofs challenging
- Most remaining sorries are for major theorems, not simple lemmas

### Stats:
- Total sorries: 163 (unchanged)
- Build status: PNT3_RiemannZeta has compilation errors with some Mathlib functions
