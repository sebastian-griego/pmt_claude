## Iteration 45 (2025-09-23T01:10:00Z)
### Fixed: Complex.arg for natural number casts
- Fixed proof that Complex.arg (p : â„‚) = 0 for prime p in PNT3_RiemannZeta
- Used `Complex.arg_coe_nonneg` with the fact that p is positive
- Also fixed subset inclusion proof in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis at line 537
- Fixed closure of open ball proof at line 556 using `Metric.closure_ball`
- These were simple API calls that needed the right function names
- Location: StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean:66, StrongPNT/PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean:537,556

**Status**: 168 sorries remaining (was 170)
