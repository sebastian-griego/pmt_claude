### Fixed: Complex.arg for natural number casts
- Fixed proof that Complex.arg (p : ℂ) = 0 for prime p in PNT3_RiemannZeta
- Used `Complex.arg_coe_nonneg` with the fact that p is positive
- Also fixed subset inclusion proof in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis at line 537
- Fixed closure of open ball proof at line 556 using `Metric.closure_ball`
- These were simple API calls that needed the right function names

## Iteration 46 (2025-09-23T01:17:00Z)
### Analysis: Subset inclusion proof challenge
- Attempted to fix the subset inclusion {z | norm z ≤ R ∧ z ≠ 0} ⊆ {z | norm z ≤ R} in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis:537
- The proof should be trivial: intro w hw; exact hw.1 (taking first component of conjunction)
- However, Lean's type system is not recognizing hw as having a product structure
- Multiple approaches attempted but all resulted in type errors
- Reverted to sorry to maintain build stability
- This appears to be a technical issue with how membership predicates are handled

**Status**: 170 sorries remaining (no change)

## Iteration 45 (2025-09-23T01:25:00Z)
### Fixed: `RealLambdaxy` complex exponential lemma
- Fixed the proof that `(vonMangoldt n * (n : ℂ)^((-x : ℂ) - (y * I : ℂ))).re = vonMangoldt n * (n : ℝ)^(-x) * Real.cos (y * Real.log n)`
- Key insights:
  - Split the exponent using `Complex.cpow_add` to separate real and imaginary parts
  - Real part of `n^(-x)` is `(n : ℝ)^(-x)` and imaginary part is 0
  - Used `lem_eacosalog3` from PNT1_ComplexAnalysis to prove `((n : ℂ)^(-(y * I))).re = Real.cos (y * Real.log n)`
  - Combined real and imaginary parts using `Complex.mul_re`
- This lemma is crucial for relating the real part of complex series to trigonometric forms
