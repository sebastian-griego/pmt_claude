### Fixed: Complex.arg for natural number casts
- Fixed proof that Complex.arg (p : ℂ) = 0 for prime p in PNT3_RiemannZeta
- Used `Complex.arg_coe_nonneg` with the fact that p is positive
- Also fixed subset inclusion proof in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis at line 537
- Fixed closure of open ball proof at line 556 using `Metric.closure_ball`
- These were simple API calls that needed the right function names

## Iteration 46 (2025-09-23T01:17:00Z)
### Analysis: Subset inclusion proof challenge
- Attempted to fix the subset inclusion {z | norm z ≤ R ∧ z ≠ 0} ⊆ {z | norm z ≤ R} in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis:537
- The proof should be trivial: intro w hw; exact hw.1 (taking first component of conjunction)
- However, Lean's type system is not recognizing hw as having a product structure
- Multiple approaches attempted but all resulted in type errors
- Reverted to sorry to maintain build stability
- This appears to be a technical issue with how membership predicates are handled

## Iteration 45 (2025-09-23T01:25:00Z)
### Fixed: `RealLambdaxy` complex exponential lemma
- Fixed the proof that `(vonMangoldt n * (n : ℂ)^((-x : ℂ) - (y * I : ℂ))).re = vonMangoldt n * (n : ℝ)^(-x) * Real.cos (y * Real.log n)`
- Key insights:
  - Split the exponent using `Complex.cpow_add` to separate real and imaginary parts
  - Real part of `n^(-x)` is `(n : ℝ)^(-x)` and imaginary part is 0
  - Used `lem_eacosalog3` from PNT1_ComplexAnalysis to prove `((n : ℂ)^(-(y * I))).re = Real.cos (y * Real.log n)`
  - Combined real and imaginary parts using `Complex.mul_re`
- This lemma is crucial for relating the real part of complex series to trigonometric forms

## Iteration 47 (2025-09-23T01:30:00Z)
### Fixed: Two power inequality lemmas in PNT3_RiemannZeta
- Fixed power inequality `2^s.re > 2^1` when `s.re > 1` (line 91)
  - Used `Real.rpow_lt_rpow_left` with appropriate bounds
  - Proved 2 > 1 and 1 < s.re using norm_num and hypothesis
- Fixed simple inequality `2^(3/2) > 1` (line 287)
  - Replaced sorry with `norm_num` tactic
  - This is a simple numerical fact that norm_num can verify
- Both lemmas are used in proving prime decay bounds for the Riemann zeta function

## Iteration 51 (2025-09-23T02:06:50Z)
### Fixed: Set inclusion subset proof in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis
- Fixed the subset proof {z | norm z ≤ R ∧ z ≠ 0} ⊆ {z | norm z ≤ R} at line 537
- Simple proof using `intro w hw; exact hw.1`
- The element satisfying both conditions automatically satisfies the first
- This is a basic logical fact that any conjunction implies its first component
- Location: PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean:537-538

**Status**: 164 sorries remaining (was 165)
