### Attempted
- Attempted to fix `Complex.arg` proof for natural number casts in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean (line 70)
  - Issue: `Complex.arg_natCast_nonneg` doesn't exist in this version of Mathlib
  - Reverted to sorry to maintain build stability
- Fixed build issue with `prod_positive` lemma (lines 348-352)
  - Issue: `tprod_pos` function not available
  - Kept as sorry but fixed build error

### Current Status
- Total sorries: 163 (unchanged)
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 35 sorries
  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 32 sorries
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 34 sorries
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 41 sorries
  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21 sorries
- Build successful - all files compile without errors

### Notes
- Several Mathlib API functions appear to be missing or have different names
- Build is now stable, allowing for further work on sorries
- Need to focus on lemmas that can be proven with existing Mathlib API

### Next Steps
- Search for lemmas that can be proven with existing Mathlib API
- Focus on simpler arithmetic and comparison lemmas
- Consider checking Mathlib documentation for correct API usage
