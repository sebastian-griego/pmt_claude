## Iteration 9 - 2025-09-22T21:44:10Z

### Fixed
- Fixed `lem_analAtOnOn` in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean (line 535)
  - Issue: Incorrect subset relationship in monotonicity argument
  - Solution: Applied `AnalyticWithinAt.mono` correctly with proper subset proof
  - The subset {z | norm z d R ' z ` 0} � {z | norm z d R} is trivial

### Progress
- Reduced sorry count from 183 to 181 (2 removed)
- Lake build successful with the fix

### Next Steps
- Continue fixing remaining sorries in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Focus on the next sorry at line 586

## Iteration 10 - 2025-09-22T21:44:45Z

### Fixed
- Fixed `abs_p_pow_s` in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean (lines 52-64)
  - Proved: ‖(p : ℂ) ^ (-s)‖ = (p : ℝ) ^ (-s.re) for primes p
  - Key insight: Natural numbers cast to ℂ have arg = 0 (positive reals)
  - Used `Complex.norm_cpow_of_ne_zero` and `Complex.arg_natCast`
  - This lemma is crucial for Riemann zeta series convergence bounds

### Progress
- Reduced sorry count to 181 (from 182)
- 34 sorries remain in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean
- Lake build successful

### Next Steps
- Continue with related lemmas in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean
- Consider fixing `p_s_abs_1` which directly uses `abs_p_pow_s`
