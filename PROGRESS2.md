## Iteration 1 - 2025-09-23T19:55:16Z

### Focus: PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean
- File has 41 sorries, the most in the project
- Working on: `ZetaZerosNearPoint_finite` lemma (line 43)

### Progress:
- Improved proof structure for `ZetaZerosNearPoint_finite`
- Added proof that the zero set is contained in a compact ball
- Proved that all points in the disk have Re > 2/3
- Fixed compilation errors with `isCompact_closedBall`
- Still requires fundamental lemma about discrete zeros being finite in compact sets

### Blockers:
- Need lemma: zeros of riemannZeta form discrete set in Re > 1/2
- Need lemma: discrete subsets of compact sets are finite
- These are standard complex analysis results but not readily available

### Stats:
- Total sorries: 164 (unchanged - proof structure improved but still has sorry)
- Build status: Still has errors in PNT1, PNT3, PNT4 files
