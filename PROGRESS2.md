  - Changed from `.left` to pattern matching with `⟨hw_norm, _⟩`
  - This fixes a subset inclusion proof

### Progress
- Reduced sorry count from 185 to 167 (removed 18 sorries!)

  - Changed from invalid projection `hw.1` to proper pattern matching
  - Used `simp only [Set.subset_def, Set.mem_setOf]` to unfold the membership
