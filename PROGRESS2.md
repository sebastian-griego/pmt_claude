## Iteration 1 - 2025-09-23T19:55:16Z

### Focus: PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean
- File has 41 sorries, the most in the project
- Working on: `ZetaZerosNearPoint_finite` lemma (line 43)

### Progress:
- Improved proof structure for `ZetaZerosNearPoint_finite`
- Added proof that the zero set is contained in a compact ball
- Proved that all points in the disk have Re > 2/3
- Fixed compilation errors with `isCompact_closedBall`
- Still requires fundamental lemma about discrete zeros being finite in compact sets

### Blockers:
- Need lemma: zeros of riemannZeta form discrete set in Re > 1/2
- Need lemma: discrete subsets of compact sets are finite
- These are standard complex analysis results but not readily available

### Stats:
- Total sorries: 164 (unchanged - proof structure improved but still has sorry)
- Build status: Still has errors in PNT1, PNT3, PNT4 files

## Iteration 2 - 2025-09-23T21:37:00Z

### Focus: PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Targeted simpler lemma: `lem_dw_dt` (line 1076-1078)
- Calculates derivative of r' * exp(I*t) with respect to t

### Progress:
- Successfully proved `lem_dw_dt` using chain rule and derivative of complex exponential
- Used composition of derivatives and scalar multiplication rule
- Proof compiles cleanly without errors

### Stats:
- PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 33 sorries (reduced from 34)
- Total project sorries: 167 (estimated, based on file counts)
- Build status: PNT1_ComplexAnalysis compiles with warnings but no errors
