[PNT0_Scaffold] Verify clean scaffold compile
- File: StrongPNT/PNT0_Scaffold.lean (80 lines)
- Status: build OK; zero sorries in file
- Imports: Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic, Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Basic
- Notes: Grepped project; sorries remain in PNT1–PNT5 (out of frontier scope). Scaffold remains minimal and ready for downstream use.

**2025-10-01** — PNT0_Scaffold refactor verification  
**Status:** ✓ Complete  
**Task:** Ensure PNT scaffolding module compiles cleanly  
**File:** `StrongPNT/PNT0_Scaffold.lean`  
**Result:**
- Module verified clean: 81 lines, no `sorry` statements
- Builds successfully with no warnings or errors
- Contains minimal imports (Real.Basic, Log.Basic)
- Provides 10 helper lemmas for logarithm simplifications
- All proofs complete and well-documented
- Ready to serve as lightweight dependency for downstream PNT work
