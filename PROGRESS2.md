## Iteration 1 - 2025-09-22T20:21:12Z

### Completed
1. **Proved `zeta_converges_re_gt_one`**: Established that the Riemann zeta series converges for Re(s) > 1 using comparison with p-series
2. **Proved `zeta_ne_zero_re_gt_one`**: Showed zeta function is non-zero for Re(s) > 1 by contradiction (first term is 1 ` 0)

### Changes Made

## Iteration 2 - 2025-09-22T20:23:12Z

### Completed

## Iteration 3 - 2025-09-22T20:26:12Z

### Completed

### Issues Encountered
- Missing Mathlib lemmas: `tprod_inv` doesn't match the expected pattern

### Changes Made
- Replaced 1 sorry with complete proof showing that for prime p ≥ 2, p^(-3/2) < 1

### Remaining
- 36 sorries remaining (note: file was auto-fixed between iterations)
