- [Scaffold] StrongPNT.PNT0_Scaffold: verified imports/namespace; build OK. Lines: 28. Blueprint coverage: N/A (scaffolding). No sorries in this module.
- [Scaffold] StrongPNT.PNT0_Scaffold: added [simp] alias log_one_real. Build OK. Lines: 28. Blueprint: N/A. Blocking: many sorries in PNT1–PNT5 (not in scope).
