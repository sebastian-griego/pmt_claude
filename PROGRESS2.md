[2025-09-30 23:56] BLOCKED — lem_removable_singularity (StrongPNT/PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean:1091)
- Reason: As stated, (fun z => f z / z) is not analytic at 0 in Lean because 0/0 = 0 by definition; the removable singularity extension requires redefining the value at 0 to deriv f 0. Adjusting the statement or definition is needed to proceed.
- Action taken: Verified scaffold module builds cleanly; deferred heavy theorem pending spec correction. Sorries remain in PNT1–PNT5.
