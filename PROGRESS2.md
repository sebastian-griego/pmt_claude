# Progress Log

## 2025-09-24T04:20:00Z

### Made partial progress on multiple complex analysis lemmas
- **lem_BCDerivBound** (line 655): Added structure for Cauchy's estimates with explicit bounds
- **lem_MaxModulusPrinciple** (line 685): Added proof structure extracting interior maximum point
- **lem_CauchyIntegral** (line 712): Added denominator simplification step
- **lem_JensenLog** (line 757): Added comment explaining harmonic function approach
- **lem_HadamardThreeCircles** (line 771): Added comment on log-convexity approach
- **lem_PhragmenLindelof** (line 827): Added auxiliary function construction approach

### Status
- Sorries remaining: 28 (unchanged - partial progress on 6 lemmas)
- All lemmas now have clearer proof outlines and partial implementations
- Schwarz lemma and Liouville's theorem are already complete

### Completed
- Proved `lem_contour_integral` in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Added import `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.Deriv.Comp` for derivative compositions
- Reduced sorry count from 31 to 30

### Implementation Details
- `lem_contour_integral`: Simply used existential witness with the integral itself since the lemma just asserts existence
- Build successfully compiles with 30 sorries remaining in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean

### Current Status
- Total sorries in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 30
- Next targets: Other simple complex analysis lemmas that can be proven with existing Mathlib

### Fixed compilation error in lem_generalPNTPrelim
- Fixed incorrect field accessor `.left` on line 540
- Changed from `hw.left` to `obtain �h1, _� := hw; exact h1`
- This properly destructures the conjunction to extract the first component

### Partial progress on lem_BCDerivBound
- Added initial structure for the proof with intro and basic hypotheses
- Still needs completion with proper Cauchy estimates

### Status
- Sorries remaining: 29 (unchanged - partial work on one)
- Build now compiles without errors on line 540
