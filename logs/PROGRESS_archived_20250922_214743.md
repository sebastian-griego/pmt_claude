## Iteration 9 - 2025-09-22T21:44:10Z

### Fixed
- Fixed `lem_analAtOnOn` in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean (line 535)
  - Issue: Incorrect subset relationship in monotonicity argument
  - Solution: Applied `AnalyticWithinAt.mono` correctly with proper subset proof
  - The subset {z | norm z d R ' z ` 0} † {z | norm z d R} is trivial

### Progress
- Reduced sorry count from 183 to 181 (2 removed)
- Lake build successful with the fix

### Next Steps
- Continue fixing remaining sorries in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Focus on the next sorry at line 586
