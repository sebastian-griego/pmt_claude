## Summary

✅ **Task completed successfully**

**Actions taken:**
1. Built `StrongPNT.PNT0_Scaffold` module - initially passed with 1 linter warning
2. Fixed linter warning in `StrongPNT/PNT0_Scaffold.lean:22` by replacing `simpa using Real.log_one` with `simp [Real.log_one]`
3. Rebuilt module - now compiles cleanly with no warnings
4. Committed changes: "Fix linter warning in PNT0_Scaffold: use simp instead of simpa"

The PNT0_Scaffold module now compiles cleanly with:
- Minimal imports (`Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic`, `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Basic`)
- Proper namespace (`StrongPNT`)
- Clean helper definitions (`SmoothingKernel` type alias, `log_one_real` lemma)
- No `sorry` statements
- No linter warnings


Perfect! The full project builds successfully. The PNT0_Scaffold module is production-ready:

**Status: ✓ Complete**

- StrongPNT/PNT0_Scaffold.lean compiles cleanly
- No `sorry` statements present
- Minimal, well-documented scaffolding in place
- Full project build: **OK** (1816 jobs)

The frontier goal is achieved. The scaffolding module provides a clean foundation for downstream PNT work with proper imports, namespace structure, and basic utilities.

Perfect! The build is clean and the PNT0_Scaffold module is already in good shape:

**Status: ✓ Complete**

The `StrongPNT/PNT0_Scaffold.lean` module is verified clean:
- Minimal imports (Real.Basic, Log.Basic) ✓
- Proper namespace structure ✓
- No `sorry` statements ✓
- Clean compilation ✓
- Well-documented with module docstring ✓

The module contains:
- `SmoothingKernel` type alias for downstream use
- `log_one_real` helper lemma with complete proof

Full build confirms all 1816 jobs completed successfully. The scaffolding is ready for dependent modules.


Excellent! The module is already clean:
✓ No `sorry` statements found
✓ Builds successfully
✓ Minimal imports (Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic, Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Basic)
✓ Proper namespace (StrongPNT)
✓ Clean documentation
✓ Simple, composable content (SmoothingKernel alias, log_one_real lemma)

The PNT0_Scaffold module meets all requirements. The full project build also passes. The refactoring goal is complete.
Error: Reached max turns (8)

**Task Complete**

The PNT0_Scaffold module is verified clean:
- Build successful with no warnings or errors
- No incomplete proofs (`sorry`)
- Proper imports, namespace, and documentation
- Minimal, idiomatic Lean 4 code
- Committed as: `de05e29`

The scaffolding module is ready to serve as a lightweight foundation for downstream PNT formalization work.


Perfect! The module is already in excellent shape:

**Status: ✓ Complete**

The `PNT0_Scaffold.lean` module is already properly refactored and compiles cleanly:
- ✓ Minimal, focused imports (`Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic`, `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Basic`)
- ✓ Clean namespace structure (`StrongPNT`)
- ✓ No `sorry` statements
- ✓ Proper documentation with module-level docstring
- ✓ Contains only trivial, complete content (`SmoothingKernel` type alias, `log_one_real` lemma)
- ✓ No linter warnings
- ✓ Builds successfully

The scaffolding is minimal, well-documented, and ready to serve as a foundation for downstream PNT modules. No changes needed.


The PNT0_Scaffold module is currently in excellent shape:

✅ **Build Status**: Clean compilation, no errors or warnings  
✅ **No sorry**: The module contains only complete proofs  
✅ **Proper structure**: 
- Minimal, focused imports (`Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic`, `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Basic`)
- Proper `noncomputable section` for real number operations
- Well-documented module docstring
- Clean namespace organization (`StrongPNT`)
- Type alias for `SmoothingKernel` placeholder
- Simple utility lemma `log_one_real` with proper `@[simp]` attribute

✅ **Idiomatic Lean 4**: Uses `abbrev` for type alias, proper theorem syntax, `simp` tactic

The refactoring goal is **complete**. The module serves its intended purpose as a lightweight scaffolding file that compiles quickly and provides basic infrastructure for downstream PNT modules.


The PNT0_Scaffold.lean file hasn't changed since the last commit - it's already in the desired clean state. The only modified files are logs, which we shouldn't commit.

**Status Summary:**

✓ **Build Status:** Clean (`lake build` succeeds with no warnings)  
✓ **PNT0_Scaffold.lean:** Already in optimal state  
  - Minimal imports (Real.Basic, Log.Basic)  
  - Clean namespace structure  
  - No `sorry` statements  
  - Contains minimal scaffolding: `SmoothingKernel` type alias and `log_one_real` lemma  
  - Compiles quickly and serves as lightweight foundation  

The refactoring task is complete - the PNT0_Scaffold module already compiles cleanly with proper structure as requested.


Excellent! The refactoring task is complete. The `PNT0_Scaffold.lean` module:

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

- Compiles cleanly with no warnings
- Contains no `sorry` statements  
- Has proper namespace structure (`StrongPNT`)
- Uses minimal, focused imports
- Includes clear documentation
- Has `noncomputable section` properly placed
- Provides useful scaffolding (type alias + helper lemma)

The module is ready to serve as a lightweight foundation for downstream PNT development.
