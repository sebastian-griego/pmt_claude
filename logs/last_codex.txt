# AGENTS.md — Strong PNT Formalization from Blueprint (Lean)

## PROJECT TYPE: CODE
Autoformalization project — implementing Lean proofs from LaTeX blueprint.

## CRITICAL RULES
1. **NEVER use `sorry`** — if you cannot prove something, STOP and report the blocker
2. **DO NOT PROCEED** to new theorems if **ANY** theorem has `sorry`
3. **Every theorem must compile** with `lake build`
4. **Match theorem names exactly** from blueprint → Lean
5. **Work on ONE theorem at a time** until FULLY PROVEN
6. **Success = zero sorries** — do not claim progress with sorries present
7. **NEVER create `.lean` files in root directory**
8. **NEVER USE EMOJIS**

## File Structure (focus only these)
- `StrongPNT/PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean`  ← implements `blueprint/PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.tex`
- `StrongPNT/PNT2_LogDerivative.lean`    ← implements `blueprint/PNT2_LogDerivative.tex`
- `StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean`      ← implements `blueprint/PNT3_RiemannZeta.tex`
- `StrongPNT/PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean`   ← implements `blueprint/PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.tex`
- `StrongPNT/PNT5_StrongPNT.lean`        ← implements `blueprint/PNT5_Strong.tex`
- `StrongPNT/Z0.lean`                    ← supporting defs
- `StrongPNT/ZetaZeroFree.lean`          ← zeta zero-free region lemmas

## Current Focus
Continue implementing theorems sequentially from the blueprint `.tex` files. Check which file has the least progress and work there.

## Iteration Protocol (EVERY iteration)
1) Run: `lake build`
2) Run: `grep -r "sorry" StrongPNT/*.lean`
   - If ANY `sorry` found → **fix those first**
   - **Do NOT** add new theorems until all sorries are resolved
3) Only if **no sorries**: implement the next theorem from the blueprint
4) Read its dependencies in the blueprint
5) Implement the Lean version (**NO `sorry` allowed**)
6) Verify: `lake build` succeeds
7) Append to `PROGRESS2.md`:
   - Theorem name and status
   - Line count of completed Lean
   - % of blueprint covered
   - Any blocking issues

## Blocked? Do this
- Re-read blueprint section; search Mathlib for similar proofs
- Use `exact?` tactic if relevant
- Still stuck after 2 attempts? Mark **BLOCKED** in progress and try a different file
- If a needed API/theorem is missing in current Mathlib, **prove it yourself** (don’t give up)

## Verification Required (after EVERY theorem)
```bash
lake build StrongPNT
# Must succeed with NO sorries

grep -r "sorry" StrongPNT/*.lean
# Must return nothing
````

## Import Management

Check imports. Common ones:

```lean
import Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.CauchyIntegral
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.ZetaFunction
-- add others as needed, but don't duplicate
```

## Don’t Modify

* `blueprint/` folder (read-only reference)
* `lakefile.lean` (unless adding new Mathlib deps)

## CRITICAL: NEVER ADD `sorry` TO PROVEN LEMMAS

* If a lemma compiles without `sorry`, **never** reintroduce `sorry`
* If fixing one lemma breaks another, find a different solution
* Adding `sorry` to a previously working proof is **REGRESSION**
* Check `git diff` before committing — reject changes that add sorries

## Progress File Rules

* **ALWAYS APPEND** to `PROGRESS2.md`, never overwrite
* Use `>>` not `>` when updating from scripts
* **Every 10 iterations**: clear `PROGRESS2.md` (by command), then keep appending from scratch

## Project Structure (DO NOT CHANGE)

Root directory: `/home/jovyan/pmt_claude/`

* Run all commands from **root**
* `lake build` runs from root
* Progress file is in root
* `lake-manifest.json` stays in root (auto-generated)
* Edit only files in `StrongPNT/*.lean` (progress file is in root)
* Read only files in `blueprint/*.tex`

## Working Directory

ALWAYS work from project root: `/home/jovyan/pmt_claude/`
Never `cd` into `StrongPNT/`

## Success Criteria

* [ ] All theorems from `PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.tex` implemented
* [ ] All theorems from `PNT2_LogDerivative.tex` implemented
* [ ] All theorems from `PNT3_RiemannZeta.tex` implemented
* [ ] All theorems from `PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.tex` implemented
* [ ] All theorems from `PNT5_Strong.tex` implemented
* [ ] Zero uses of `sorry` in any file
* [ ] Full lake build succeeds
