The main challenges were:\n\n1. **API compatibility issues** - Many of the complex analysis APIs I tried to use either don't exist in the current Mathlib version or have different signatures\n2. **Dependent lemmas** - Some lemmas like `condp32` depend on other sorry lemmas like `abs_p_pow_s`, creating a dependency chain\n3. **Complex analysis requirements** - Most remaining sorries involve deep complex analysis results that require specific Mathlib APIs\n\nThe project maintains a stable build with 188 sorry declarations across the five main PNT files.","session_id":"e7f4a75d-fb74-408a-ae6a-893cd06e9aa4","total_cost_usd":6.622569749999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":265,"cache_creation_input_tokens":60131,"cache_read_input_tokens":2975689,"output_tokens":13447,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":60131}},"modelUsage":{"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":21335,"outputTokens":503,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.019080000000000003},"claude-opus-4-1-20250805":{"inputTokens":265,"outputTokens":13447,"cacheReadInputTokens":2975689,"cacheCreationInputTokens":60131,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":6.6034897500000005}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"09ce0a8d-f9f2-4452-a198-893aea11968c"}
