Here's what I found:\n\n### Current State\n- **Total sorries: 165** distributed across:\n  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 35\n  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 33  \n  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 31\n  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 45\n  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21\n\n### Key Finding\nThe build currently has several errors due to missing or changed Mathlib API functions. The codebase appears to have been written for an older version of Mathlib, with functions like:\n- `Complex.summable_nat_cpow`\n- `analyticWithinAt_of_analyticAt`\n- `tprod_pos`\n\nnot being available in the current version.\n\n### Attempted Fix\nI tried to prove the `prod_positive` lemma in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean (showing that an infinite product of positive terms is positive), but the required function `tprod_pos` doesn't exist, so I had to revert the change.\n\n### Next Steps\nBefore further progress can be made on reducing sorries, the build errors need to be resolved by either:\n1. Fixing the API calls to match the current Mathlib version\n2. Focusing only on lemmas that use stable, existing API functions\n3. Updating the imports or finding equivalent functions in current Mathlib\n\nThe progress has been documented in PROGRESS.md.","session_id":"6016eeae-8e96-4cf6-a608-61accf79c4ec","total_cost_usd":5.50024385,"usage":{"input_tokens":120,"cache_creation_input_tokens":50195,"cache_read_input_tokens":2492278,"output_tokens":10659,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":50195}},"modelUsage":{"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":18987,"outputTokens":1064,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.019445600000000004},"claude-opus-4-1-20250805":{"inputTokens":120,"outputTokens":10659,"cacheReadInputTokens":2492278,"cacheCreationInputTokens":50195,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":5.480798249999999}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"ed174ef3-9ec7-4414-b122-ba73eb0d5d39"}
