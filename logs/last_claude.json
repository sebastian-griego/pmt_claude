Fixed build errors in PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean:\n   - Fixed `isCompact_closedBall` API issue\n   - Fixed the calc chain proof that points in the disk have Re > 2/3\n\n2. Attempted to fix `Complex.arg_natCast` in PNT3 but the API function doesn't exist, so reverted to sorry\n\n3. Reverted attempted fix to `lem_blaschke_pow_diff_nonzero` in PNT2 due to API incompatibility\n\n### Current Status:\n- **Total sorries: 164** (increased from 161 due to fixing build errors)\n  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 34 sorries\n  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 33 sorries \n  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 36 sorries\n  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 40 sorries\n  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21 sorries\n\nThe net increase in sorries was necessary to fix build errors caused by missing Mathlib API functions. The system also automatically added a proof for `lem_cost0` showing cos(0) = 1. Build errors remain but have been reduced.","session_id":"24389349-35d4-49ee-b153-46d7fc91cee5","total_cost_usd":4.447374349999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":111,"cache_creation_input_tokens":58583,"cache_read_input_tokens":1615413,"output_tokens":12087,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":58583}},"modelUsage":{"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":19292,"outputTokens":550,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0176336},"claude-opus-4-1-20250805":{"inputTokens":111,"outputTokens":12087,"cacheReadInputTokens":1615413,"cacheCreationInputTokens":58583,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":4.42974075}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"01a5f023-0b79-48be-9524-b7e98df004f7"}
