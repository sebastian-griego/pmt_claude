The key achievement was completing the proof of `condp32`, which shows that `1 - p^(-(3/2 + I*t)) ≠ 0` for any prime p. This is an important lemma for analyzing the Riemann zeta function. The proof was completed with the help of the linter, which expanded the calculation chain showing that `p^(-3/2) < 1` for primes p ≥ 2.","session_id":"5fb4e92b-c1f6-4f34-9ff2-429c226f8dbc","total_cost_usd":3.3236883,"usage":{"input_tokens":117,"cache_creation_input_tokens":43994,"cache_read_input_tokens":1244628,"output_tokens":8285,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":43994}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-1-20250805":{"inputTokens":117,"outputTokens":8285,"cacheReadInputTokens":1244628,"cacheCreationInputTokens":43994,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":3.3149595},"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":9561,"outputTokens":270,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0087288}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"5b590522-ea1b-4ac0-820a-a514752b9e5b"}
