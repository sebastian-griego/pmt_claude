The project has 163 total `sorry` statements. Key issues include:\n\n1. Missing API functions like `Complex.arg_natCast_of_ne_zero`, `inv_lt_one`, and `Real.rpow_lt_rpow_of_exponent_lt`\n2. Mathlib version incompatibility - many expected functions don't exist\n3. Build errors prevent testing fixes properly\n\nThe progress has been documented in PROGRESS.md. To make further progress, the project would benefit from either updating to match current Mathlib APIs or finding workarounds for the missing functions.","session_id":"71803804-e768-4667-9b50-5f77d21dc187","total_cost_usd":3.29005145,"usage":{"input_tokens":165,"cache_creation_input_tokens":31639,"cache_read_input_tokens":1345980,"output_tokens":8764,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":31639}},"modelUsage":{"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":18154,"outputTokens":888,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0180752},"claude-opus-4-1-20250805":{"inputTokens":165,"outputTokens":8764,"cacheReadInputTokens":1345980,"cacheCreationInputTokens":31639,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":3.2719762500000007}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"d2c7b77b-2a6e-457d-ab15-feccede6a7b2"}
