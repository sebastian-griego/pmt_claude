While I made several attempts to fix simple lemmas, the final sorry count remains at 165. The main challenges were:\n\n1. **Mathlib API changes**: Several functions like `Real.rpow_lt_rpow_of_exponent_lt` have changed signatures\n2. **Automatic linting**: The build system's linter kept modifying proofs automatically, making it difficult to maintain stable fixes\n3. **Complex proofs**: Most remaining sorries require substantial mathematical proofs rather than simple tactics\n\nThe PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean file was automatically fixed by the linter to properly use `Real.rpow_lt_rpow_of_exponent_lt`, but this didn't reduce the sorry count as it was fixing an existing attempt rather than removing a sorry.","session_id":"e07340e5-98df-4503-8c0f-f2806864c4da","total_cost_usd":13.7236456,"usage":{"input_tokens":79,"cache_creation_input_tokens":78070,"cache_read_input_tokens":7002855,"output_tokens":22920,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":78070}},"modelUsage":{"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":32532,"outputTokens":2335,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.035365600000000004},"claude-opus-4-1-20250805":{"inputTokens":79,"outputTokens":22920,"cacheReadInputTokens":7002855,"cacheCreationInputTokens":78070,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":13.68828}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"acb44925-5632-4365-ab87-af458e57bca0"}
