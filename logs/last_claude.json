The external linters have been very active fixing various lemmas automatically. The current status is:\n\n**166 sorries remaining** (build currently failing on PNT1_ComplexAnalysis)\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Fixed compilation errors in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis related to set membership projections\n2. External linters automatically fixed multiple lemmas in PNT3_RiemannZeta and PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion\n3. Updated PROGRESS.md with the current status\n\nThe majority of remaining sorries are complex mathematical theorems requiring deep proofs in:\n- Complex analysis (Cauchy integrals, Maximum modulus principle)\n- Riemann zeta function properties (Euler product, functional equation)\n- Zero-free region analysis\n- Prime Number Theorem main results\n\nThe build is currently failing but the sorry count has been reduced through automatic fixes by external tools.","session_id":"2d691576-4eb5-408b-92ef-bdb41df1598d","total_cost_usd":5.256946250000003,"usage":{"input_tokens":109,"cache_creation_input_tokens":47437,"cache_read_input_tokens":2379676,"output_tokens":9553,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":47437}},"modelUsage":{"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":23195,"outputTokens":1234,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.023492},"claude-opus-4-1-20250805":{"inputTokens":113,"outputTokens":9554,"cacheReadInputTokens":2408127,"cacheCreationInputTokens":48161,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":5.233454250000002}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"42d75993-5fbc-44b8-a67f-acdd6d50d413"}
