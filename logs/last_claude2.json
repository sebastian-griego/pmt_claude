The remaining sorries are primarily for non-trivial mathematical results that would require significant proof development.","session_id":"62faed30-23c8-4ddd-89e9-3c53ffe7d72b","total_cost_usd":5.421567999999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":175,"cache_creation_input_tokens":62230,"cache_read_input_tokens":2319311,"output_tokens":10168,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":62230}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-1-20250805":{"inputTokens":175,"outputTokens":10168,"cacheReadInputTokens":2319311,"cacheCreationInputTokens":62230,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":5.411003999999998},"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":10315,"outputTokens":578,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.010564}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"806242db-b01c-4bcb-9169-a67cdc51ca32"}
