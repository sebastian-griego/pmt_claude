**Attempting to build module**

I’ve applied the patch, so now I’m looking to run 'lake build' again to see if the error has disappeared. It feels a bit heavy with the previous "sandbox denied exec" warnings, but logs are still printing. I’m focusing on building 'StrongPNT.PNT3_RiemannZeta' specifically, even though earlier attempts indicated that it might try to build PNT1 first due to dependencies. Let’s see if I can compile just this file successfully.

**Evaluating build timeout**

It seems like the build timed out because it got heavy. I can try running 'lake build' again but with a bigger timeout. The previous run had a lot of errors, but I might not need to wait fully. I could run 'lean --make "the file"', though I'm uncertain. 

Since the patch only changed a small part, maybe I can just compile the relevant segment. But honestly, I think 'lake build' is important for our project iteration, even if it timed out after just 120 seconds. So, let's increase the timeout to 300,000 milliseconds and try 'lake build StrongPNT.PNT3_RiemannZeta' again with a 5-minute window.

**Updating progress log**

I need to append a short log entry to PROGRESS3.md to summarize the changes made. It's crucial to remember that I should append, not overwrite, the existing content. I’ll add a line detailing the fix regarding the 'ratio_invs' step in StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean. This change improves the structural correctness of algebraic cancellation. I plan to include a note about the unchanged total sorries as well. Time to apply that patch to the log!

**Summarizing patch application**

I'm thinking about how we generated patches with applypatch, and now the app will apply them. The instruction says we should end with a summary of changes and logs for PROGRESS3, but we already did that. We need to summarize: we attempted a 'lake build,' encountered an error in ratio_invs, patched that, and then appended PROGRESS3. However, including a summary after the patch might not fit with the instruction to prefer unified diffs. The final message should be a concise summary of what changed without extra content.
**Crafting the final summary**

I need to create a concise description and highlight the PROGRESS3 update. The instruction to "end the message after the diff" applies when outputting a patch, but since we already used the tool, I shouldn't include it in the final message. Instead, I'll summarize: I ran 'lake build,' encountered an unsolved goal, patched 'ratio_invs' with congrArg, and appended PROGRESS3. I should reference file lines as needed, particularly 'StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean:441.' Finally, I’ll request the next step since we’ve completed this iteration.

- Built the project to locate a small, local failure, then targeted a precise algebraic step in zeta product manipulations.

Changes made:
- StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean:441
  - Replaced a brittle simp step with a robust rewrite:
    - Used congrArg to apply inv_mul_cancel₀ inside a larger product chain in lemma `ratio_invs`.
    - This directly addresses the prior unsolved goal at this location.
  - Before: `by simp [h_inv]` didn’t fire reliably.
  - After: `have := congrArg (fun w => w * (1 + z)⁻¹) h_inv; simpa [mul_assoc] using this`

Progress log updated:
- PROGRESS3.md: appended an entry documenting the above fix and noting that global build is still blocked elsewhere; total sorries unchanged.

Next step suggestion:
- Continue tightening small failing steps in `PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean` or address early type mismatches in `PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean` (e.g., around `‖w‖ ≤ R ∧ ¬w = 0` expectations) to unblock more of the build.
