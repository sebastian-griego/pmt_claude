**Checking for improvements**

I feel like we’ve made a good small update by removing the unused lemma with "sorry." Now, according to our iteration protocol, I should run the command `grep -r "sorry" StrongPNT/*.lean` to check if it's indeed reduced by one. It’s not mandatory, but it seems like a quick and efficient step to confirm the improvement. I’ll go ahead and run that command!

I ran a quick build (timed out), then scanned for sorries and removed one unused placeholder lemma to reduce the count.
