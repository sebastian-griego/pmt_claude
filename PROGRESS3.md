2025-09-25: Added helper lemma `cpow_neg` in `StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean` (lines 342-345) - provides formula z^(-s) = (z^s)⁻¹ for complex powers with negative exponents. Infrastructure lemma for manipulating negative exponents in Euler product formulas. Total sorries: 104.
2025-09-26: Fixed bad import in `StrongPNT/PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean` (line 12) by switching to `import StrongPNT.PNT3_RiemannZeta` (previous chapter) instead of the non-namespaced `PNT1_ComplexAnalysis`. This resolves the “unknown module prefix” build error and aligns imports with project structure. Build still blocked by existing errors/sorries in `PNT3_RiemannZeta`. Total sorries: unchanged.
2025-09-26: Corrected import in  to  (was non-namespaced). Removes the module prefix error so build can progress to next issues. No new sorries added.
2025-09-26: Corrected import in `StrongPNT/PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean` to `import StrongPNT.PNT3_RiemannZeta` (was non-namespaced). Removes the module prefix error so build can progress to next issues. No new sorries added.
2025-09-26: Updated `cpow_neg_inv` in `StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean` to rely directly on Mathlib’s `cpow_neg` and removed the unnecessary nonzero hypothesis. Fixes a type-mismatch error in that lemma’s proof. Build still blocked by other errors/sorries; totals unchanged.
2025-09-26: Refactored `lem_sum_m_rho_bound` in `StrongPNT/PNT2_LogDerivative.lean` to avoid `field_simp`/`ring` by giving a direct algebraic proof that `R / R₁ = 3/2` (via `eq_div_iff_mul_eq`). Also started converting Jensen’s logarithmic inequality into a bound by dividing through by `log(3/2) > 0`. This targets the prior “unsolved goals” at that point and progresses the proof structure. Remaining sorries and simplification tactics still block full build.
2025-09-26: Rewrote  in  to a direct algebraic proof using  and inverse identities, removing reliance on /. This makes the step robust and reduces automation dependence. Total sorries: unchanged.
2025-09-26: Rewrote ratio_invs in StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean to a direct algebraic proof using (1 - z^2) = (1 - z)(1 + z) and inverse identities, removing reliance on field_simp/ring. This makes the step robust and reduces automation dependence. Total sorries: unchanged.
2025-09-26: Fixed type mismatches in `StrongPNT/PNT2_LogDerivative.lean` around Jensen-bound division: replaced a faulty `inv_mul_cancel` simplification with a clean inequality step via `le_div_iff₀`, and reconciled a coercion mismatch using `Nat.cast_sum`. Verified `lake build StrongPNT.PNT2_LogDerivative` succeeds. Total sorries: unchanged overall.
2025-09-26: Reduced elaboration issues and fixed a local proof in `StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean`: reintroduced `prod_of_ratios` with explicit type arguments to help Lean's elaborator, added a local `set_option maxHeartbeats 800000` to avoid timeouts, and cleaned up `ratio_invs` by giving direct non-vanishing proofs for `1 - z ≠ 0` and `1 + z ≠ 0` (removing the previous “No goals to be solved” error). Build still fails later in `PNT3_RiemannZeta` due to heavy use of infinite product lemmas and remaining sorries. One small step toward stabilizing this file.
2025-09-26: Removed two unused placeholder lemmas `lower_bound_product` and `real_prod_bound` from `StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean` that contained only `sorry` and had no references. This trims dead code and reduces the surface area of sorries without affecting dependencies. Build still blocked by other issues in `PNT3_RiemannZeta`. Total sorries: decreased slightly in this file.
2025-09-26: Removed unused placeholder lemma `lem_analytic_zero_factor` from `StrongPNT/PNT2_LogDerivative.lean` (previously at lines ~193-200). It contained a `sorry` and had no references; deleting it reduces the active sorries without affecting dependencies. Verified `lake build StrongPNT.PNT2_LogDerivative` succeeds. Total sorries: -1 in this file.
2025-09-26: Removed duplicate lemma  in StrongPNT/PNT5_StrongPNT.lean to prevent redefinition conflict; keeps the earlier, complete proof. No new sorries added.
2025-09-26: Removed duplicate lemma `Li_pos` in `StrongPNT/PNT5_StrongPNT.lean` to prevent redefinition conflict; kept the earlier, complete proof. No new sorries added.
2025-09-26: Removed local `norm_inv` lemma in `StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean` that shadowed Mathlib’s global `norm_inv`. This avoids spurious nonzero side-goals during `rw [norm_inv]` (e.g., in `abs_term_inv_bound`), relying on the standard lemma instead. Small, targeted cleanup; build still blocked by remaining sorries and other issues in this file.
2025-09-26: Fixed two issues in `StrongPNT/PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean`: (1) replaced the non-existent `Metric.closure_ball` with Mathlib’s `closure_ball` lemma, and (2) corrected a subset proof in `lem_analAtOnOn` to avoid the “Invalid projection” error by converting set membership to propositions before concluding. Build still fails later in this file due to other pending errors/sorries. Total sorries: unchanged.
