2025-09-25: Added helper lemma `cpow_neg` in `StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean` (lines 342-345) - provides formula z^(-s) = (z^s)⁻¹ for complex powers with negative exponents. Infrastructure lemma for manipulating negative exponents in Euler product formulas. Total sorries: 104.
2025-09-26: Fixed bad import in `StrongPNT/PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean` (line 12) by switching to `import StrongPNT.PNT3_RiemannZeta` (previous chapter) instead of the non-namespaced `PNT1_ComplexAnalysis`. This resolves the “unknown module prefix” build error and aligns imports with project structure. Build still blocked by existing errors/sorries in `PNT3_RiemannZeta`. Total sorries: unchanged.
2025-09-26: Corrected import in  to  (was non-namespaced). Removes the module prefix error so build can progress to next issues. No new sorries added.
2025-09-26: Corrected import in `StrongPNT/PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean` to `import StrongPNT.PNT3_RiemannZeta` (was non-namespaced). Removes the module prefix error so build can progress to next issues. No new sorries added.
2025-09-26: Updated `cpow_neg_inv` in `StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean` to rely directly on Mathlib’s `cpow_neg` and removed the unnecessary nonzero hypothesis. Fixes a type-mismatch error in that lemma’s proof. Build still blocked by other errors/sorries; totals unchanged.
2025-09-26: Refactored `lem_sum_m_rho_bound` in `StrongPNT/PNT2_LogDerivative.lean` to avoid `field_simp`/`ring` by giving a direct algebraic proof that `R / R₁ = 3/2` (via `eq_div_iff_mul_eq`). Also started converting Jensen’s logarithmic inequality into a bound by dividing through by `log(3/2) > 0`. This targets the prior “unsolved goals” at that point and progresses the proof structure. Remaining sorries and simplification tactics still block full build.
2025-09-26: Rewrote  in  to a direct algebraic proof using  and inverse identities, removing reliance on /. This makes the step robust and reduces automation dependence. Total sorries: unchanged.
2025-09-26: Rewrote ratio_invs in StrongPNT/PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean to a direct algebraic proof using (1 - z^2) = (1 - z)(1 + z) and inverse identities, removing reliance on field_simp/ring. This makes the step robust and reduces automation dependence. Total sorries: unchanged.
2025-09-26: Fixed type mismatches in `StrongPNT/PNT2_LogDerivative.lean` around Jensen-bound division: replaced a faulty `inv_mul_cancel` simplification with a clean inequality step via `le_div_iff₀`, and reconciled a coercion mismatch using `Nat.cast_sum`. Verified `lake build StrongPNT.PNT2_LogDerivative` succeeds. Total sorries: unchanged overall.
