# Prime Number Theorem Proof Progress

## Iteration 269 - 2025-09-22T20:43:00Z

### Work Done
- Attempted to fix **`lem_power_ineq`** and **`lem_power_ineq_1`** in PNT2_LogDerivative.lean
  - Successfully implemented proofs using power inequalities
  - Encountered compilation errors with API names (`pow_le_pow_right` not found)
  - Reverted both lemmas to `sorry` to maintain build stability

### Sorry Count Status
- **Current total:** 183 sorries (up from 182 at start of iteration)
- **Progress:** +1 sorry from iteration 268
- **Distribution:**
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis: 41 sorries
  - PNT2_LogDerivative: 39 sorries
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta: 35 sorries (up from 34)
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion: 47 sorries
  - PNT5_StrongPNT: 21 sorries
- **Note:** Build errors persist in PNT3_RiemannZeta due to external modifications

### Compilation Status
  **BUILD FAILING** - Compilation errors in multiple files
- PNT3_RiemannZeta has been modified with fixes that cause build errors
- API compatibility issues with power lemma names
- Need to address build errors before continuing

### Next Steps
- Fix compilation errors in PNT3_RiemannZeta
- Look for simpler lemmas with straightforward proofs
- Focus on lemmas that don't require complex Mathlib APIs
