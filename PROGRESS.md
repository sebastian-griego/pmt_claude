## Iteration 2025-09-24T06:58:34Z

### Status Check
- Verified current sorry count remains at 151 across all files

- PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 32 sorries
- PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 34 sorries
- PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 45 sorries
- PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21 sorries

### Notes
- Compilation issues in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean prevent full testing

## Iteration 2025-09-24T07:10:37Z

### Completed
- Partially proved `lem_Schwarz` in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Handled the boundary case where ‖z‖ = 1 directly using the hypothesis
- Reduced sorry count from 19 to 18 in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean

### Implementation Details
- Modified proof structure in `lem_Schwarz` to handle boundary and interior cases separately
- For boundary points (‖z‖ = 1), directly applied the given bound ‖f z‖ ≤ 1
- Replaced complex incorrect logic with cleaner case analysis
- Left interior case as sorry for future work requiring proper Schwarz lemma application

### Current Status
- Total sorries: 150 (reduced from 151)
- PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 18 sorries (still has compilation errors at other lines)
- Other files unchanged

### Notes
- File still has compilation errors at lines 545, 756 and others unrelated to this change
- The Schwarz lemma proof needs proper application of Mathlib's complex analysis tools for interior
- Made progress on one of the simpler cases within the lemma

### Next Steps

- Complete the interior case of Schwarz lemma using Mathlib's tools
- Continue with simpler lemmas that don't require deep complex analysis
