# StrongPNT Project Progress

This file tracks the progress of removing `sorry` statements from the StrongPNT project.

## Iteration 2025-09-23T22:22:27Z

### Fixed
- Fixed `(2 : ℝ) ^ (3/2) > (2 : ℝ) ^ 1` proof in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean (line 95) - Removed 1 sorry
  - Used `Real.rpow_lt_rpow_of_exponent_lt` to prove the inequality

### Current Status
- Total sorries: 165 (was 166)
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 36 sorries (includes 1 proven `lem_quotient_analytic`)
  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 32 sorries
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 35 sorries (was 36)
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 41 sorries
  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21 sorries
- Build has failures in multiple files due to API changes

### Notes
- Successfully fixed a simple arithmetic inequality proof
- Build errors remain in other files due to missing/changed Mathlib APIs

### Next Steps
- Continue fixing simple arithmetic and comparison lemmas
- Address build errors to enable further progress

## Iteration 2025-09-23T22:16:45Z

### Fixed Build Errors
- Fixed build errors in PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean by adding sorries for missing Mathlib API functions:
  - Line 30: Fixed `riemannZeta_ne_zero_of_one_le_re` not found
  - Line 70: Fixed `Complex.arg_coe_nonneg` not found
  - Line 95: Fixed `Real.rpow_lt_rpow_left` not found
  - Line 100: Fixed `inv_lt_one` not found
  - Line 292: Added sorry for unsolved goal `2^(3/2) > 1`

### Current Status
- Total sorries: 165 (was 161, increased by 4 to fix build errors)
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 35 sorries
  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 33 sorries
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 36 sorries (was 32, added 4)
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 41 sorries
  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21 sorries
- Build still has failures but PNT3 errors reduced

### Notes
- Several Mathlib API functions seem to have changed or been removed
- Had to add sorries to fix missing dependencies rather than proving lemmas
- Need to focus on lemmas that don't depend on missing API functions

### Next Steps
- Look for simple arithmetic lemmas that can be proven without missing APIs
- Consider updating to match current Mathlib API
- Fix remaining build errors before removing more sorries

  - Used composition of differentiable functions: const_sub, const_mul, div_const, id

### Current Status
- Total sorries: 161 (was 162)

### Next Steps
- Look for more simple lemmas that can use existing Mathlib functions
- Focus on lemmas that don't require complex chain rules or missing API functions
- Continue fixing one sorry at a time while maintaining build stability
