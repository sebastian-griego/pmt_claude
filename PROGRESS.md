## Iteration 47 (2025-09-23T01:45:21Z)
### Fixed: `lem_Z1split` sum decomposition in PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion  
- Proved that after applying `Finset.sum_insert`, the goal is directly achieved
- The rewrite statement produces exactly the expected sum decomposition
- Simple fix: replaced `sorry` with `rfl` after the rewrite
- This lemma splits a sum over zeros for analysis purposes
