## Iteration 2025-09-24T03:53:27Z

### Completed
-  Proved `lem_Liouville` in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean using Mathlib's `Differentiable.apply_eq_apply_of_bounded`
-  Reduced sorry count from 164 to 163

### Implementation Details
- Added import for `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Liouville`
- Replaced sorry with complete proof using:
  1. Established differentiability from analyticity hypothesis
  2. Proved boundedness of range using the given bound
  3. Applied Mathlib's Liouville theorem
  4. Constructed existential witness using f(0) as the constant value

### Current Status
- Total sorries remaining: 163
- Files with sorries:
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 31
  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 30
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 29
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 52
  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21

### Next Steps
- Continue proving fundamental complex analysis lemmas in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Focus on lemmas that can be proven using existing Mathlib theorems

## Iteration 2025-09-24T06:39:28Z

### Attempted
- Fixed compilation error in `lem_analAtOnOn` by properly handling subset proof
- Attempted to prove `lem_removable_singularity` using Mathlib's `dslope` function
- Added imports for `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.DSlope` and `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.RemovableSingularity`

### Implementation Details
- Fixed set membership proof in `lem_analAtOnOn` line 541-544
- Explored using `dslope` which handles removable singularities
- The proof attempt was incomplete due to type mismatches

### Current Status
- Total sorries remaining: 152
- Files with sorries:
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 20
  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 32
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 34
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 45
  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21

### Notes
- Reduced sorries in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis from 31 to 20
- The proof of `lem_removable_singularity` remains incomplete with a sorry
- Total sorry count increased from 151 to 152 due to recent git commits

### Next Steps
- Complete the proof of `lem_removable_singularity` using power series expansion
- Continue proving other complex analysis lemmas with existing sorries

## Iteration 2025-09-24T06:49:20Z

### Attempted
- Investigated remaining sorries in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean
- Attempted to fix compilation errors in lem_analAtOnOn
- Explored proving lem_CauchyIntegral and lem_removable_singularity
- Reverted changes due to compilation errors

### Current Status
- Total sorries remaining: 151
- Files with sorries:
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 19 (reduced from 20)
  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 32
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 34
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 45
  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21

### Notes
- File compiles successfully with 19 sorries
- Many complex analysis lemmas require deep integration theory from Mathlib
- Focus should be on simpler lemmas that can be proven with existing tools

### Next Steps
- Target simpler lemmas in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean that don't require complex integration
- Consider proving auxiliary lemmas that support the main theorems
- Look for lemmas that can be proven using existing Mathlib results
