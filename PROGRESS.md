  - Complex analysis (contour integration, maximum modulus principle)
  - Analytic number theory (Dirichlet series, zero-free regions)
  - Asymptotic analysis (prime number theorem estimates)

### Analysis:
- The codebase is at a stage where simple computational sorries have been resolved
- Remaining sorries require either:
  - Deep theoretical results not yet in mathlib
  - Complex combinations of existing mathlib results
  - Asymptotic analysis machinery for error bounds

### Next Steps:
- Would need to import more specialized mathlib modules for:
  - Contour integration theory
  - Dirichlet series and L-functions
  - Asymptotic expansions

## 2025-09-26 02:37 - Analyzed current sorry count and repository state

### Issues Analyzed:
1. **Total sorry count**: 97 sorries across 5 main files
   - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 19 sorries
   - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 15 sorries
   - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 23 sorries
   - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 19 sorries
   - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 21 sorries

2. **Attempted monotonicity proofs**
   - `chebyshevPsi_monotone` and `chebyshevTheta_monotone` require summability of von Mangoldt and log primes
   - These need deep results about Dirichlet series convergence

3. **Most remaining sorries require deep theory**:
   - Isolation of zeros theorem for holomorphic functions
   - Asymptotic expansions of the Riemann zeta function
   - Zero-free region theorems
   - Contour integration and residue theory
   - Multipliability conditions for infinite products

### Status:
- Total sorry count: 97
- All simple arithmetic and definitional sorries have been resolved
- Remaining sorries require advanced analytic number theory results
- Build process is very slow due to complex proofs

### Next Steps:
- Focus on importing additional mathlib modules that provide needed theorems
- Consider proving auxiliary lemmas that would help reduce multiple sorries
- Work on documenting which specific mathlib theorems would eliminate each sorry
- Consider focusing on specific theorem dependencies to identify which mathlib results would enable the most progress

## 2025-09-26 02:45 - Proved monotonicity lemmas in PNT5_StrongPNT.lean

## 2025-09-26 19:03 - Improved h_re_bound proof in PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean

### Issues Addressed:
1. **Improved h_re_bound proof** (PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean line 65-93)
   - Added geometric proof that points in disk have Re(z) ≥ 2/3
   - Proved |Re(z) - 3/2| ≤ |z - (3/2 + ti)| ≤ 5/6
   - This gives Re(z) ≥ 3/2 - 5/6 = 2/3
   - The strict inequality still requires showing no zeros lie on Re = 2/3

- Current distribution:
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 19 sorries
  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 15 sorries
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 22 sorries

- Current distribution:
  - PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean: 19 sorries
  - PNT2_LogDerivative.lean: 15 sorries
  - PNT3_RiemannZeta.lean: 22 sorries
  - PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean: 19 sorries
  - PNT5_StrongPNT.lean: 20 sorries

### Analysis:
- Most remaining sorries require deep theoretical results:
  - Complex analysis: Cauchy integral formula, maximum modulus principle, isolated zeros theorem
  - Analytic number theory: Dirichlet series convergence, Euler product theory, zero-free regions
  - Asymptotic analysis: Prime counting estimates, logarithmic integral asymptotics
- Simple arithmetic and computational sorries have mostly been resolved
- The `Li_tendsto_top` lemma requires integral asymptotic bounds that are non-trivial

### Attempted but Not Completed:
1. **h_re_bound strict inequality** (PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean)
   - Requires proving no zeta zeros lie on Re(s) = 2/3
   - This is a deep result about zero distribution

2. **Li_tendsto_top** (PNT5_StrongPNT.lean)
   - Requires showing Li(x) → ∞ as x → ∞
   - Needs integral lower bounds or asymptotic analysis

## 2025-09-26 19:49 - Improved h_re_bound proof in PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean

### Issues Addressed:
1. **Improved h_re_bound proof** (PNT4_ZeroFreeRegion.lean line 65-117)
   - Narrowed down the proof to show exactly which zero would cause a problem
   - Proved that if z.re = 2/3 exactly, then z must equal 2/3 + ti
   - Used geometric argument: if |z - (3/2 + ti)| ≤ 5/6 and z.re = 2/3
   - Then |-5/6 + (y-t)i| ≤ 5/6 which forces (y-t)² ≤ 0, so y = t
   - The proof still requires showing riemannZeta(2/3 + ti) ≠ 0 (deep theory)

2. **Attempted lem_removable_singularity improvement** (PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean)
   - Added power series expansion approach for f(z)/z when f(0) = 0
   - Still requires showing the shifted series converges

### Status:
- Total sorry count remains at 95
- Made partial progress on h_re_bound by precisely identifying the problematic zero
- Most remaining sorries still require deep theoretical results

### Next Steps:
- Continue searching for simpler sorries that can be eliminated
- Focus on lemmas that can use existing Mathlib theorems directly

## 2025-09-26 19:56 - Fixed compilation error in PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean

### Issue Fixed:
1. **Fixed undefined identifier in lem_removable_singularity** (PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean line 1250)
   - Changed `simp [hfz]` to `simp [hf0]` to fix compilation error
   - The correct hypothesis name is `hf0` (representing f(0) = 0)

### Status:
- Fixed compilation error in lem_removable_singularity
- Total sorry count reduced from 95 to 94
- Build process remains slow but compilation error is resolved

### Next Steps:
- Continue finding and fixing simple sorries
- Focus on lemmas that can be proven using existing Mathlib results
- Work towards further reducing the sorry count
