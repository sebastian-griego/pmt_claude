### Status
- Total sorries: 35
- Files: StrongPNT/PNT1_ComplexAnalysis.lean

### Recent Changes
- Fixed lem_absdiv lemma at line 1255-1256: Changed from `simp [norm_div, hb]` to `exact norm_div hb`
- Attempted to fix projection issue at line 537-538 (reverted due to compilation issues)
- Attempted to fix lem_dw_dt derivative lemma at line 1089-1091 (reverted due to missing imports)

### Notes
- Build successful with warnings about unused variables and 35 sorry declarations
- Many complex analysis theorems remain to be proved (Borel-Caratheodory, Maximum Modulus Principle, Cauchy Integral, etc.)
- Basic algebraic lemmas in the latter part of the file appear to be complete
